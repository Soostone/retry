name:                retry

description: 

        This package exposes combinators that can wrap arbitrary
        monadic actions. They run the action and potentially retry
        running it with some configurable delay for a configurable
        number of times.

        The purpose is to make it easier to work with IO and
        especially network IO actions that often experience temporary
        failure and warrant retrying of the original action. For
        example, a database query may time out for a while, in which
        case we should hang back for a bit and retry the query instead
        of simply raising an exception.
